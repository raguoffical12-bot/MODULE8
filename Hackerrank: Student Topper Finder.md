EXPTNO.8a Program to find Find the simple interest

### Aim: To Write a Python Program to find Find the simple interest by getting the principal, rate and time value from the user
### Algorithm:

STEP 1: Start.

STEP 2: Define a function.

STEP 3: Create variable 'p','r','t' for principal,rate of interest and time. STEP 4: Get the input of p,r and t from user.

STEP 5 : Using the formula (p*r*t)/100 calculate the result. STEP 6: Print the result.

STEP 7: Stop.

### Program:
```
reg no:212223070021
name:Ragunandhan S
principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
rate = float(input("Enter the rate of interest: "))
time = float(input("Enter the time period (in years): "))

simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100

print(f"The simple interest is: {simple_interest}")


```
### Output:
